#### Romantic Interest

* Shows a private and personal side of your protagonist that would not otherwise become known;
* Provides the opportunity for a steamy sex scene to satisfy the needs of your story's genre;
* Creates conflict or even crisis at times when the external plot is at a low point of narrative tension;
* Acts as a confidante to allow the protagonist to share his emotions and quandaries through active scenes and dialogue;
* Creates a love bond that could be threatened by the antagonist to raise the stakes of the story;
* Shows difficulty and crisis in the romantic interest to add pressure for change on the character;
* Acts as a sounding board or mentor for the protagonist's decisions;
* Develops a full subplot with an additional point of view for the intimate other, also allowing for characterization of the protagonist.

#### Minor Characters

* Move the action forward;
* Be careful they don't overshadow other, more important, characters.
