The pain is eternal.

Somewhere, part of me is still cracked-open and heart-broken feeling pain that won't stop.

Here, I've managed to close myself off to the pain, and am floating in an anxious numbness.

I'm not sure who I feel more sorry for.

Magic is in both criminal, countercultural, black-market worlds and in more prosaic, governmental worlds

Two couples are friends, one in each pair are almost having an affair.

The man in that is captured or somehow killed, and the woman must go in for him in lieu of his wife.

Voluptuous style. (At odds with genre.)

Basic story dynamic is Orpheus.
