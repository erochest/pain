# Disasters

1. what appears to be a typical assignment goes horribly wrong, and one person dies, kind of;
2. in order to save him, in order to find him in the afterlife, she must be open to him, and thus unprotected from the pain of the afterlife, but she accepts this pain, although it leaves her largely incapacitated;
3. because of a mistake she made on the way in, they are unable to leave the afterlife the way they came, and they must pass through the Lethe (or he is forced to drink it by a particularly cruel gatekeeper).
4. she is able to somehow integrate the pain and rejoin the world, but without love or life, passing time numbly.

# Thresholds

1. **special world**: Accepting the assignment brings them into the special world of magic.
2. **inmost cave**: Journeying into the afterlife ushers her into the inmost cave.
3. **return**: Leaving the afterlife (though another route?) returns her to the "normal" world.

# Short Paragraph

Two couples who work together in a paranormal unit of the NSA are sent on an assignment that they question. Their misgivings are well founded, and one of the men is sucked into limbo, an area of the afterlife where he's not fully alive nor fully dead. In order to find him, the woman must cross into the afterlife and must leave herself defenseless against the pain of the underworld, so that when she does find him, she's now unable to put up any defenses. The psychopomp agrees to guide them back out, but requires him to drink from the river to erase the secrets of death that he has learned, leaving him also unable to get out. She overcomes her pain enough to move on, and they cooperate and return to the world, but she is still dealing with the pain and loneliness.

# Longer Paragraph

Two couples who work together in a paranormal unit of the NSA are sent on an assignment. A man and woman from the group are not quite having an affair. Everyone is reluctant, but with encouragement they decide to go. Their misgivings are well founded, and the man from the not-affair is sucked into limbo, an area of the afterlife where he's not fully alive nor fully dead. The woman, because of her specialty, is the best to pursue him. She crosses into the afterlife, but messes up the spell and closes the door behind her so that she won't be able to return the same way. In order to find him, she must leave herself defenseless against the pain of the underworld. (There are options, but none good, and she chooses this one.) She does find him, but is unable to put up any defenses, so that she is stumbling in constant pain. They decide to go out through the Lethe in order to escape the hell-hounds and demons. The psychopomp, to guide them the wrong way across the Lethe, requires him to drink from the river to erase the secrets of death that he has learned. The psychopomp does say that most of his life, the public parts, especially, will be put back into place. She realizes that he won't remember them, and she won't be able to remind him. The psychopomp lets on that he realizes and delights in this twist. They return to the world, but she is still dealing with the pain and loneliness.
