Samantha rescues the man she loves at the cost of his forgetting her and constant pain.

## Abstract Motivation

To save that man from limbo.

## Conflict

* Rescuing people from limbo is not done, and there are conflicts and complications related to that.
* Her own emotional instability.
* Her own conflicted feelings and desires.
* Dealing with her pain.
* Dealing with Jacob's inability.

## Epiphany

She can't have everything she wants in life. She can fight for it, but she won't succeed. She also must let go. He is able to finally be free also when she lets go. But things still don't turn out the way she wants.

## One-Paragraph Summary

Sam starts out in an almost affair with her partner, Jacob. They've managed to resist, however, and then he is kind of killed, and she has to go rescue him. She makes it back, but the force that's holding him requires pain, which she offers. It's not physical pain, but mental, emotional, and it's crippling. She leads Jacob out of the underworld, but to leave, he has to drink the river Lethe, which will remove his memory of the underworld and of things he experienced there. This will include his memories of Sam and their relationship. She agrees, but this just deepens her pain, makes it more engrained. Finally, outside, she realizes that she needs to let him go. The pain doesn't disappear, but is deadened. She's not happy with the way things turn out, but she is at peace with it.

[I need to make letting go, open handedness be a theme, a pressure, thoughout the work.]

# Instructions

The above gives you a high-level view of your novel. Now you need something similar for the storylines of each of your characters. Characters are the most important part of any novel, and the time you invest in designing them up front will pay off ten-fold when you start writing. For each of your major characters, take an hour and write a one-page summary sheet that tells:

- The character's name
- A one-sentence summary of the character's storyline
- The character's motivation (what does he/she want abstractly?)
- The character's goal (what does he/she want concretely?)
- The character's conflict (what prevents him/her from reaching this goal?)
- The character's epiphany (what will he/she learn, how will he/she change?
- A one-paragraph summary of the character's storyline

An important point: You may find that you need to go back and revise your one-sentence summary and/or your one-paragraph summary. Go ahead! This is good--it means your characters are teaching you things about your story. It's always okay at any stage of the design process to go back and revise earlier stages. In fact, it's not just okay--it's inevitable. And it's good. Any revisions you make now are revisions you won't need to make later on to a clunky 400 page manuscript. 

Another important point: It doesn't have to be perfect. The purpose of each step in the design process is to advance you to the next step. Keep your forward momentum! You can always come back later and fix it when you understand the story better. You will do this too, unless you're a lot smarter than I am.
