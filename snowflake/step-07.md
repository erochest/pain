Take another week and expand your character descriptions into full-fledged
character charts detailing everything there is to know about each character.
The standard stuff such as birthdate, description, history, motivation, goal,
etc. Most importantly, how will this character change by the end of the novel?
This is an expansion of your work in step (3), and it will teach you a lot
about your characters. You will probably go back and revise steps (1-6) as
your characters become "real" to you and begin making petulant demands on the
story. This is good -- great fiction is character-driven. Take as much time as
you need to do this, because you're just saving time downstream. When you have
finished this process, (and it may take a full month of solid effort to get
here), you are ready to write a proposal and sell this novel. Do so.
